                    <p>"Malaria is a disease that affects millions of people around the world, particularly children
                        under 5 and women. Malaria is prevalent in some of the most unmapped places. Malaria is a
                        preventable and curable disease, but currently organisations do not have detailed data on the
                        number of vulnerable people in an area, which reduces their ability to respond."

                    <p>"A cholera epidemic affects the Mozambique since the beginning of the year. Several regions are
                        concerned and even the capital Maputo knows many cases. The peak of the epidemic appears behind
                        us, but the country remains an endemic area for cholera. Some places in the north and in the
                        west are regularly faced with killing waves. Therefore, it is highly necessary to proceed to a
                        substantive treatment of the epidemic."

                        children in 18 states across northern Nigeria. The area of Northern Borno is one vital area
