                    <p>"Tanzania has a high incidence of extreme poverty, early marriage and Gender Based Violence. NGOs on the ground need better road and residential area data to facilitate their outreach work. Community mappers from a HOT microgrant, together with YouthMappers from the Institute of Rural Development Planning will map employment opportunities as part of a project to reduce youth vulnerability starting on 26th August. This base map will assist with this field mapping."
