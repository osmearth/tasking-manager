# Roadmap

## Plan 

### 0-2 months
* Resolve performance and scalability issues
* Conduct user testing and a design review
* Resolve feature parity between TMv2 and TMv3
* Refactor frontend to React

### 2 - 4 months
* Add groups/organizations for improved project and team management
* Add new analytics for users, projects, groups
* Add AI/ML integration for improved mapping efficiency

### 4 - 6 months
* Improved validation methods
* Data quality feedback, integrations

## Longer term ideas/directions

- Address the overlap of TM and MapCampaigner functionalities, should they be separate tools
- Improve the connection between remote and field (not just API but workflow and engagement)
- Support moving from creating data in unmapped areas to updating areas with new imagery or information
